Lima's command-line interface (CLI) tool, `limactl`, provides intuitive commands for managing your VMs. Create, start, stop, and delete VMs with ease, all from the comfort of your terminal. Lima's extensive configuration options enable you to tailor the VM to your specific needs. Easily allocate resources like CPU cores, memory, and disk space, or fine-tune network settings, port forwarding rules, and other parameters. This flexibility empowers you to create VMs optimized for specific tasks, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

A Versatile Tool for Diverse Use Cases: Linux, Kubernetes, and Beyond
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Lima's applications extend far beyond simply running Linux distributions. Its container-friendly nature and support for various container runtimes, such as containerd, Docker, and Podman, make it an ideal platform for containerized workloads. Whether you're developing cloud-native applications, experimenting with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, or building portable development environments, Lima provides a solid foundation for your container-based workflows. Lima's versatility shines through its compatibility with a wide range of guest operating systems, including popular Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and many more. This allows you to choose the environment that best aligns with your project requirements and personal preferences.
