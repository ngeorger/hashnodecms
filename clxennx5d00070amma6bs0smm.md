Kueue is a powerful tool designed to enhance job queueing and resource management within Kubernetes clusters. By offering a set of APIs and a controller, **Kueue empowers you to efficiently manage job execution, resource allocation, and overall cluster performance.**

> Kueue is a cloud-native job queueing system for batch, HPC, AI/ML, and similar applications in a Kubernetes cluster.  
>   
> Use Kueue to build a multi-tenant batch service with quotas and a hierarchy for sharing resources among teams in your organization. Based on the available quotas, Kueue decides when jobs should wait and when and where they should run.  
>   
> Kueue works in combination with standard kube-scheduler, cluster-autoscaler, and the rest of the kubernetes ecosystem. This combination allows Kueue to run both on-prem and in the cloud, where resources can be heterogeneous, fungible, and dynamically provisioned.

Key Features for Optimized Kubernetes Workloads
-----------------------------------------------

*   **Job Management:** Kueue enables prioritized job queueing with flexible strategies like `StrictFIFO` and `BestEffortFIFO`.
*   **Resource Management:** Achieve fair resource sharing and implement preemption policies between different tenants.
*   **Dynamic Resource Reclaim:** Automatically release quota as job pods complete, maximizing resource utilization.
*   **Resource Flavor Fungibility:** Enable quota borrowing or preemption in ClusterQueues and Cohorts for enhanced flexibility.
*   **Wide Range of Integrations:** Seamlessly integrate with popular job types, including BatchJob, Kubeflow training jobs, RayJob, RayCluster, JobSet, and plain Pods.
*   **Enhanced System Insights:** Gain valuable insights into your system's state through built-in Prometheus metrics and Conditions.

Production Readiness and Robust Support
---------------------------------------

Kueue boasts a mature v1beta1 API version, comprehensive documentation, extensive test coverage, and scalability verification. With regular releases, robust security, and a growing list of adopters in production environments, Kueue is a reliable solution for managing your Kubernetes workloads.

Installation and Usage Made Easy
--------------------------------

Kueue is compatible with Kubernetes 1.22 and above. Install the latest release effortlessly with a single command:
