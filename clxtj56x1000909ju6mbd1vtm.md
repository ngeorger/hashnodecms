**Reasons Your Organization Needs a Business Continuity Plan**
--------------------------------------------------------------

### **1\. Competitive Edge**

When a crisis hits, a well-prepared business continuity plan allows you to bounce back quickly. This minimizes downtime, lost revenue, and damage to your reputation. 

Your company may differentiate itself as an expert and one that can be depended upon by quickly restoring access to your company's data and documents, reestablishing employee communication, and enabling staff to assist customers.

### **2\. Backups are not enough**

An enterprise backup often exceeds one petabyte in size. This strains the boundaries of traditional storage. Capacity and bandwidth can be strained even by a small to mid-sized firm backing up many terabytes of data. If your gear or data center isn't equipped to manage this amount of data, it becomes useless.

Organizations may operate vital business applications from backup instances on cloud-based virtual servers by implementing business continuity and disaster recovery solutions that make use of cloud technologies and virtual servers. With this strategy, you can minimize downtime and efficiently "flip a switch."

### **3\. Insurance does not protect your data**

Cyberattacks are becoming more proficient and effective globally. Insurance may not cover replacing lost data as a result of a breach in the data center, server, backup, or even loss of access.

Moreover, even if insurance does cover the cost of repairs, the entire cost of a disaster's damages will not be covered. It can pay for the repairs, but it cannot make up for the income loss and missed business opportunities brought on by downtime.

### **4\. Disaster Recovery**

Disasters can occur at any point. That is what makes them so devastating—their unexpectedness. Major occurrences like earthquakes, floods, and natural catastrophes are among the main causes of IT outages. Moreover, accidents, inept workers, user behavior that compromises security, and human error-related data erasure can also cause significant downtimes.

Recovery from such occurrences is made possible by business continuity, which lays out the steps that must be followed to guarantee that activities continue regardless of the type of disaster. A recovery plan asks the following questions and addresses them:

*   Can you move to a server or network housed in a running data center in the event of a power outage?
*   Do you have a standby server (or virtual server) available in case of server failure?
*   Can your staff operate remotely in the event that your office site becomes unusable?

When creating your business continuity strategy, you take into account every scenario that might arise. Offsite and redundant backup continues to be one of the most crucial components of IT resilience, mostly due to the possibility of power outages or office relocation.
