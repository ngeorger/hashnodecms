### Simplified Image Creation

One of the most noticeable things about Podman Desktop is its simplified image creation process. Gone are the days of wrestling with complex command-line instructions. Instead, Podman Desktop provides intuitive wizards that guide you through the process of selecting base images, defining dependencies, and customizing configurations. It's like having a friendly assistant who holds your hand through the entire process.

### Code Integration

Podman Desktop integrates seamlessly with popular code editors and IDEs. This allows developers to effortlessly build images from their projects, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment. No more jumping back and forth between different tools. You can stay focused on your code and let Podman Desktop handle the heavy lifting.

### Multi-Stage Builds

Podman Desktop supports multi-stage builds, which streamlines image construction by allowing developers to separate build steps from final container configurations, resulting in smaller, optimized images. This is a boon for keeping your images lean and mean, which in turn improves performance and reduces resource consumption.

### Image Optimization

Podman Desktop also helps minimize image sizes through automatic layer caching and optimized build processes. The tool automatically caches layers during image builds, which reduces build time and improves performance. This means you spend less time waiting for images to build and more time coding.

Running and Managing Containers
-------------------------------

### Interactive Container Management

Podman Desktop provides a central hub for managing running containers. You can easily start, stop, restart, and view logs for your containers all in one place. The tool also provides detailed information about your containers, including resource usage, network connections, and file system access, making it easy to monitor and troubleshoot your applications.
